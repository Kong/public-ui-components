```ts
import { EntityDeleteModal, EntityBaseTable } from '@kong-ui-public/entities-shared'
import '@kong-ui-public/entities-shared/dist/style.css'
```

## Sandbox shared utilities

The individual entities sandboxes all share some common components/utilities which lives in the `/packages/entities/entities-shared/sandbox/shared` folder and can be imported via the `@entities-shared-sandbox/...` alias. Those components **are not** getting exported by the package and are only available in "dev" environment.
